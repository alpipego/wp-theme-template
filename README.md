## wp-theme-template

My starting point for creating a wordpress theme, built with foundation5, grunt, libsass, bourbon

* Changed scss/foundation/components/_grid.scss line 98 `collapse: false` to `collapse: true`

Add the namespace in `functions.php`, this will be the theme textdomain as well. Check functions `path()` and `get_path()` to see if they reflect your folder structure.
